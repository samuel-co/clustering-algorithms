This python module is used to create a series of clusters using a Competitive Learning algorithm.
The module utilizes the normalized data version of the algorithm. Input data is automatically normalized.
complear_clustering() is the primary function, others are helper functions. Parameters are the data points,
number of output nodes on the network, the maximum training iterations, and learning rate. Returns a list
of clusters, each cluster represented as a list of the points contained.

    ''' Create a list of clusters utilizing the Competitive Learning algorithm. This algorithm normalizes
        the data to run. Parameters are the data to be clustered, number of output nodes, max training
        iterations, and the learning rate. The network is randomly intialized, then trained on a randomly
        selected point. Only the winning node's weights are updated after each training iteration. The
        network is trained until a stable state is reached, or the max number of iterations have been run.
        Once trained, the points are classified by which output node wins, and these clusters are then
        returned.'''
