Project 4: DB-Scan
December 11, 2017

This python module is used to create a series of clusters using the DB-Scan algorithm. db_clustering() is the
primary function, find_border and expand_cluster are helper functions. Requires data points to be clustered
and the minimum number of local points for a core as parameters. Radius is an optional parameter, it can be
calculated if not supplied. Returns a list of clusters, each cluster represented as a list of the points contained.

NOTE: This line of code is used to calculate the Euclidean distance between points x and y of any matching dimensions
math.sqrt(sum([(a - b) ** 2 for a, b in zip(x, y)]))

def db_clustering(data, num_points, radius=None):
    ''' Create a list of clusters through the DBScan algorithm. Parameters are the data points to be clustered,
        the minimum number of neighboring points required to create a core point, and the radius to search for
        these neighbors. The algorithm iterates over each data point, checking if it can be a core point. If so,
        the point is passed to the expand cluster function. This function will grow the cluster by analyzing each
        neighboring point to determine if it's of adequate density to be in the cluster. If so, this point is added,
        then all of its neighbors are evaluated for the same criteria. This is performed until no more neighbors
        are left to evaluate. Returns a list of clusters, each cluster represented as a list of the points contained. '''
