The first four graphs show the resulting clusters produced by k-Means, DB-Scan, CompLearn, and PSO algorithms on a mock
2 dimensional, 2 class dataset. The x and y axis represent each data point's values, while the color represents the cluster
it belongs to. Up to six different colored clusters can be plotted.

The final series of graphs demonstrate the execution of the ACO algorithm on the mock 2 dimensional, 2 class dataset.
The x and y axis represent positions within the grid of the data points, while the color of the point represents which
class it belongs to. Note that points will disappear from the grid when an ant is holding them, reappearing when its
placed back onto the grid.

The second program execution shows the algorithm executing on the iris dataset. It doesn't produce any charts, however
the text output is still displayed, mirroring what was done during actual tests.
